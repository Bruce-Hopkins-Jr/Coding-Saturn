# [The Coding Saturn](https://bruce-hopkins-jr.github.io/Coding-Saturn/)

* The Coding Saturn is a single paged website was designed to display lessons in programming, linking to outside sources. Sadly none of the links go anywhere yet but once their able to set everything up I will link all of the social medias and communities.

## Requierements 

* I'm using gatsby V2. Every npm package I use is in the `package.json`, so just run `npm install` and you should be good to go. 

## Setup

* The `smoothscroll.polyfill()` in the `header.js` is important if you want to use the scrollspy, otherwise the website jumps to each section.
* Obviously the icons are not necesary

## Files and Directories

* `index.js` and `index.css` are the main content
* `our-services.js` and `our-services.css` is the section right bellow the the first. 
* `Card.js` and `Card.css` is used for the cards within `our-services.js`
