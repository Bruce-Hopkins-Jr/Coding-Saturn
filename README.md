<h1> The Coding Saturn </h1>
<p> The Coding Saturn is a single paged website was designed to display lessons in programming, linking to outside sources. Sadly none of the links go anywhere yet but once their able to set everything up I will link all of the social medias and communities. </p>

<h2> Requierements </h2>
<p> I'm using gatsby V2. Every npm package I use is in the package.json, so just run 'npm install' and you should be good to go. </p>

<h2 href="google.com"> Setup </h2>
<p> The 'smoothscroll.polyfill();' in the header.js is important if you want to use the scrollspy, otherwise the website jumps to each section. </p>
