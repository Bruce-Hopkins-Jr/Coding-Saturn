# The Coding Saturn
* The Coding Saturn is a single paged website was designed to display lessons in programming, linking to outside sources. Sadly none of the links go anywhere yet but once their able to set everything up I will link all of the social medias and communities.

## Requierements 
* I'm using gatsby V2. Every npm package I use is in the package.json, so just run 'npm install' and you should be good to go. 

## [Setup] (http://cobydesigns.budgetchamp.net/)
* The 'smoothscroll.polyfill()' in the header.js is important if you want to use the scrollspy, otherwise the website jumps to each section.
* Obviously the icons are not necesary
